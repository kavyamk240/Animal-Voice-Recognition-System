# Animal-Voice-Recognition-System
Animal finder is an AI-based innovative system for animal voice recognition and classification to identify animals using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. Animal finder is designed to work with audio recordings of animal sounds, which are input into the system. The system uses wavelet filters to de-noise the audio and pre-processing techniques to convert the raw audio data into a suitable format for analysis. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) is used to extract the features of sound. The feature extracted data is then fed into an LSTM model, which is trained on a large dataset of animal sounds to learn the temporal and spectral patterns of different animal species.

ANIMAL FINDER WEB APP:
  The animal finder web app module built using python flask is a web-based user interface that enables users to interact with the animal finder system.
  Sound uploading: The web app module allows users to record animal’s sounds using upload sound files from their computer or phone.
  Animal identification: The animal finder system uses AI-based technology to analyze the sound recordings and identify the animals species present in the recording.
  The results are displayed to the user, along with information about the animal species.

END USER INTERFACE:
  The end-user module of the animal finder system is designed to provide animals enthusiasts, researchers, and conservationists with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface to interact with the system.
  End users: Server admin and ornithologists or general user
  User login: Users can create an account or log in to their existing account to access the animal finder system.
  User profile: The end-user dashboard module displays the user's profile information, including their name, email, and other details.
  Settings: The module allows users to adjust the settings of their account, including notification preferences and account information.

ANIMAL SOUND CLASSIFICATION:
  Upload animal sound dataset: The animal finder web app module built using python flask enables users upload sound files from their computer or phone.
  Preprocessing: Wavelet filtering is a technique used to decompose a signal into its constituent wavelets, which can be used to remove noise from the signal.
  Feature extraction: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are a commonly used technique for feature extraction in animal sound recognition systems like animals finder.
  LSTM animals sound classification: Once features have been extracted from animal sounds using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), LSTM can be used to classify different animal species.

ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION:
  The user interface module allows user to easily interact with the system, while the database module stores information about animal species to aid in identification.
  Upload animals sound: Users can upload their animal sound recordings.
  Predictions: The system will automatically identify the species of animal based on its unique vocalizations.
  Database module: This module stores information about animal species, including their unique vocalizations and other identifying characteristics.

RECOMMENDATION:
  In animal finder's, animal suggestion modules provide users with recommendations for animal species they may be interested in based on their location and other preferences.
  Species database: The system maintains a database of animal species, including their geographic distribution and other identifying characteristics.
  Recommendation engine: The recommendation engine uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's profile and past animal’s sightings to provide personalized recommendations for new animals species to look out for in their area.
  Animal finder can provide users with personalized recommendations for new animal species to look out for in their area.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
  The performance of animal voice recognition and classification system can be analyzed using various metrics.
  1. Accuracy: The accuracy of the system is defined as the percentage of correct animal species identification over the total number of animal sound recordings tested.
  2. Precision: The precision of the system is the ratio of true positive animal species identifications to the total number of positive identifications (i.e., the number of times the system identified animal species correctly).
  3. Recall: The recall of the system is the ratio of true positive animal species identifications to the total number of actual animal species recordings in the dataset.
  4. F1 Score: The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single value that represents the overall performance of the system.
